## Goal

[The ESP-IDF API](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/provisioning/provisioning.html) provides
> An extensible mechanism to the developers to configure the device with the Wi-Fi credentials and/or other custom configuration using various transports and different security schemes. Depending on the use-case it provides a complete and ready solution for Wi-Fi network provisioning along with example iOS and Android applications. Or developers can extend the device-side and phone-app side implementations to accommodate their requirements for sending additional configuration data.

This component makes this API available as a component using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE GATT based) transport scheme. A phone (Android/iOS) is used to communicate with the ESP32 device over BLE.  The phone app can discover and connect to the device without requiring user to go out of the phone app.

## Example

An example can be found in the [`test`](test) directory.

1. Build, and flash the `test/build/factory.bin`.

2. Using the Espressif BLE Provisioning phone app, `scan` and connect to the ESP32.  Then specify the WiFi SSID and password. Depending on the version of the app, you may have to change `_ble_device_name_prefix` to `PROV_` in `test/main/main.c`, and change the `config.service_uuid` in `ble_prov.c`.
Personally, I still use an older customized version of the app.

3. After provisioning the WiFi SSID and password are stored in the `nvs` partition of flash memory.  

## Usage

The software has been tested on the ESP-IDF SDK v4.1-beta2 and v4.3-dev-472-gcf056a7d0 with accompanying tools.

Clone this component in your project's `components` directory, or use it as a git submodule.

Copy the `Kconfig.example` to `Kconfig` and update the configuration.

In your project's `sdkconfig.defaults`, specify  a custom `partition.csv`.  An example of `sdkconfig.defaults` is shown below.
```
# Override some defaults so BT stack is enabled and
CONFIG_BT_ENABLED=y
CONFIG_BTDM_CONTROLLER_MODE_BLE_ONLY=y
CONFIG_BTDM_CONTROLLER_MODE_BR_EDR_ONLY=
CONFIG_BTDM_CONTROLLER_MODE_BTDM=
# factory binary is larger than default size
CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM=y
CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM_FILENAME=partitions.csv
CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_FILENAME=partitions.csv
# need 4 MByte flash for OTA updates
CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_4MB=y
```

An example of `partition.csv` that includes `factory` and `nvs` partitions is shown below.

```
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags
nvs,      data, nvs,      0x09000,  0x004000,
otadata,  data, ota,      0x0d000,  0x002000,
phy_init, data, phy,      0x0f000,  0x001000,
factory,  app,  factory,  0x010000, 0x150000,
ota_0,    app,  ota_0,    0x160000, 0x140000,
ota_1,    app,  ota_1,    0x2A0000, 0x140000,
coredump, data, coredump, 0x3E0000, 128k
```

Refer to the example in the [`test` directory](test) for details on how to integrate the `ble_prov()` functionality.

To provision the WiFi credentials using a phone app, this `factory` app advertises itself to the phone app.  The Espressif BLE Provisioning app is available as source code or from the app stores:
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.provble)
- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/esp-ble-provisioning/id1473590141)

The WiFi SSID and password are stored in the `nvs` partition of flash memory.  

## OTA Update

To complete the experience, this provisioning should be combined with an OTA Update mechanism such as my [ESP_OTA-Update](https://github.com/cvonk/ESP32_ota-update-task) repository.  This allows the provisioning to trigger an OTA update of the application code.  

A good place to initiate the OTA update would be after receiving `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP`.
